          <h1>About me</h1>
          <span>Tinotenda Damu</span>
          <p>
            Picture a little boy sitting in fron of a bulky computer with a Windows Vista operating system using  a mechanical keyboard and 
            a traditional mouse (the one with a ball in it), that was me around the age of 10. I was a big fan of computer games at that time.
            I would play Minesweeper , Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 and Mortal Kombat 4 from dusk till dawn. </br>

            As I grew older my fascination with technology (specifically computers) grew too. Often my PC would crash , I would attempt to troubleshoot
            and fix the issue(s).This usually involved me playing around with the software and when it was hardware I would then take my father's 
            set of screwdrivers and open it up. </br>

            I was not always succesful but even through the failures, I found great joy in what I did. It helped me to learn the basics of hardware 
            and how it was connected. Whilst most of my peers enjoyed playing outside I focused on customizing the computer and learning how to type.
            By the time I was 13, I could type basic documents like letters and CVs with a relatively fast speed. </br>

            In high school, I took up ICT (Information , communication and technology) as a subject to learn more about technology. 
            It was such a mind-opening experience where I was exposed to a lot of things that I did not know. Outside the classroom , I took a few 
            courses on the side namely ICDL (International Computer Driver's License), CISCO IT essentials , CISCO CCNA (Routing and Switching) and 
            CISCO Cybersecurity. 
          </br>
            I was accepted at the Univeristy Of Limpopo to study Mathematical and Computer Science. The degree equipped me with a lot of in depth knowledge
            of the world of IT . Upon the completion my degree I engaged myself in a few personal projects to implememnt the skills and knowledge 
            I had obtained throughout my years of schooling. 
          </br> </br>
            In all the years I have lived on this earth (short as they may be ), I have realized that learning is a never ending process. 
            I am a student of life and I am eager to learn everyday. It is my hope that you have learnt too .... learnt something about me.
